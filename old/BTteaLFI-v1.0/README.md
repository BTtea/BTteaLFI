*Used for identifying and discovering exploitable LFI vulnerabilities.*

**This PoC is for learning and research purposes only. Do not use it for illegal activities; you are solely responsible for any legal consequences.**

**Note that this tool cannot comprehensively detect the existence of LFI exploits. It is designed to partially identify simple exploitable vulnerabilities and includes some built-in filter bypass mechanisms. If you are a penetration tester or a red team specialist, it is recommended to attempt manual testing, as it may prove more effective than relying solely on this tool.**
