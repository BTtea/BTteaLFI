# bttealfi
![](../lib/data/img/logo.png)
"bttealfi is an open-source penetration testing tool that can automatically detect and exploit LFI vulnerabilities. It offers a wide range of parameters and uses content-based detection techniques to try to uncover potential weaknesses.

If a penetration tester is highly familiar with LFI vulnerabilities, they can leverage CVE-2024-4577 to enumerate files (in cases where RCE is blocked by a WAF), or if they have SQL injection-to-LFI access, this tool can save time on enumerating or downloading files, thereby further exposing target information and weaknesses.

# Installation

`git clone https://github.com/BTtea/BTteaLFI.git`

Only supports Python 3.x versions

# Usage

`python bttealfi.py -h`

* Basic parameters: mark the injection point with '*'

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch`

* Clear successful injection records

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch --flush-session`

* You can add the `-v` parameter to set the verbosity level of messages [0-6]

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3`

* You can use the `--move` parameter to set the path traversal depth, default is 5

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3 --move 5`

If you already know the path depth and donâ€™t want to traverse, use `--depth-path`

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3 --depth-path 8`

* You can use `--test-skip` to skip testing certain payloads based on the messages, for example if the info contains `passwd` or `relative path access`

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3 --test-skip "passwd,relative path access"`

* You can customize the payload by adding a prefix and/or suffix

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3 --prefix "test/" --suffix "%00"`

* If the target has a WAF or filters, you can use the `--tamper` parameter to apply predefined bypass scripts. You can also write your own scripts for the tool to use. To bypass multiple rules, separate scripts with commas (FIFO order is applied)

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3 --tamper dotslashobfuscate,base64encode`

* When you successfully exploit the target and list payloads, use `--lfi-shell` to easily enumerate files on the target system

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3 --lfi-shell`

If the targetâ€™s response contains too much extra information, affecting the retrieved file content, use `--detect-prefix` and `--detect-suffix` to specify the content range to capture

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3 --lfi-shell --detect-prefix "content prefix" --detect-suffix "content suffix"`

If you donâ€™t need to display content, or you just want to download some binary files, use `--dump` to automatically save the retrieved files locally

`python bttealfi.py -u "http://target/vuln.php?page=*" --batch -v 3 --lfi-shell --dump`

# Notes
Sqlmap is truly a perfect and outstanding tool, making my penetration testing work convenient and fast. However, there isnâ€™t a fully automated tool for LFI that I find really practical. I also grew tired of having to redesign exploitation scripts every time I discovered an LFI vulnerability. Therefore, I started this project based on my own experience and by referencing some operational behaviors of sqlmap, attempting to weaponize LFI exploitation. I intentionally chose not to directly reference sqlmapâ€™s code as a personal challenge. Every time I complete a feature, I increasingly appreciate how truly powerful and elegant sqlmap is.

That said, this project has not fully met my expectations. There are many features I want to implement but havenâ€™t yet, mostly due to my limited programming experience, which makes maintaining the code difficult. In fact, I am preparing for a fourth refactoring of this project ðŸ˜‰.


# Future Development Goals
* Refactor the code and optimize modularizable functions as well as verbose implementations
* Add a new parameter `--phpinfo`
* Add a key parameter `--os-shell`
* Introduce 4096 (Linux) and 256 (Windows) suffix truncation testing techniques
* Extensions of the `--os-shell` feature:
  * Exploit RCE for all detected techniques
  * Detect and exploit pearcmd.php
  * Detect and exploit CVE-2024-4577
  * Detect and exploit CVE-2024-2961
  * Exploit phpinfo.php through race conditions
  * Exploit Session Upload Progress via race conditions
